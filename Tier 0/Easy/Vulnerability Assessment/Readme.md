## Security Assessments : 

There are several types of pentest : 
- Black Box (no knowledge).
- Gray Box (knowledge of an employee who does not work in IT).
- White Box (full access to all systems).

There are several areas of pentesting :
- Application.
- Network or infrastructure.
- Physical.
- Social Engineering.

There are several specialists :
- Blue Team.
- Red Team.
- Purple Team.

## Vulnerability Assessment : 

![[VulnerabilityAssessment_Diagram_06a.png]]

A `Vulnerability` is a weakness or bug in an organization's environment. Une vulnérabilité peut être enregistré dans la [Common Vulnerability Exposure database (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/) et reçevoir un score [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator).

![[threat_vulnerability_risk.png]]

A `Threat (menace)` is a process that amplifies the potential of an adverse event, such as a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability.

An `Exploit` is any code or resources that can be used to take advantage of an asset's weakness.

`Risk` is the possibility of assets or data being harmed or destroyed by threat actors.

To resume : 
- `Risk`: something bad that could happen.
- `Threat`: something bad that is happening.
- `Vulnerabilities`: weaknesses that could lead to a threat.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) : 

We calculate the risk of a threat or vulnerability based on five main factors (0 to 10):
- Damage Potential.
- Reproducibility.
- Exploitability.
- Affected Users.
- Discoverability.
