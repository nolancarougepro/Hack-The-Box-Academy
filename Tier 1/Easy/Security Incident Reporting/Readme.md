Upon identification of an incident, it is imperative to categorize it to facilitate the prioritization and allocation of resources for an effective response. This categorization also aids in comprehending the nature of the incident, thereby informing subsequent briefings to stakeholders.

Examples of Incident Types :

- `Malware`: Malicious software encompassing viruses, worms, and ransomware.
- `Phishing`: Fraudulent endeavors to exfiltrate sensitive information, predominantly via email.
- `DDoS Attacks`: Deliberate attempts to inundate a system or network, thereby disrupting its regular functionality.
- `Unauthorised Access`: Incidents where unauthorized entities gain access to systems or data repositories.
- `Data Leakage`: Inadvertent exposure of confidential data, both within and outside the organizational perimeter.
- `Physical Breach`: Unauthorized physical access to secure locations.

Incident Severity Levels :

- `Critical` (P1): Imminent threats that jeopardize core business functionalities or sensitive data, necessitating immediate intervention.
- `High` (P2): Latent threats to business operations that, while not immediately detrimental, are of elevated priority.
- `Medium` (P3): Incidents that, although not posing an immediate threat to business operations, warrant timely attention.
- `Low` (P4): Trivial incidents or routine anomalies that can be managed within standard operational workflows.

## The Incident Reporting Process : 

### 1. Initial Detection & Acknowledgement : 

Before any incident can be formally reported, it must first be detected and acknowledged. Detection vectors can vary, ranging from human observation to automated alerts generated by deployed security tools.

### 2. Preliminary Analysis : 

During this phase, the scope and potential ramifications of the security incident must be ascertained. The incident should be categorized based on our previously established classification and severity metrics.

### 3. Incident Logging : 

Every facet, action, and observation related to the security incident should be meticulously logged using an established system. Popular platforms for this purpose include [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and [TheHive Project](https://thehive-project.org/). In the absence of such a system, alternative methods should be employed.

### 4. Notification of Relevant Parties : 

Stakeholders must be promptly identified, and notifications should be segmented into:

- `Internal Communications`
    - Relevant internal departments, such as IT, legal, PR, and executive teams, should be alerted. In cases where the incident has widespread and severe implications, an organization-wide notification may be warranted.
- `External Communications`
    - Depending on the incident's nature and impact, external communications may be necessary. This could involve notifying customers, partners, regulatory bodies, or even the general public.

### 5. Detailed Investigation & Reporting :

The duration of this phase can vary significantly, ranging from a couple of days to potentially years. What's crucial here is a comprehensive technical analysis coupled with a compilation of all findings. This in-depth investigation is vital for understanding the incident's full impact.

### 6. Final Report Creation :

The culmination of your role as a security analyst or incident responder is the creation of a finalized incident report. This document will furnish regulators, insurers, and executive leadership with a detailed account of the incident, its origins, and the remedial actions taken.

### 7. Feedback Loop ! :

Post-incident reflection is essential for enhancing our preparedness for future incidents. This involves revisiting and analyzing the incident to identify areas for improvement.

Far from being a mere procedural formality, the reporting process is a strategic asset that enhances an organization's resilience against security threats. Through rigorous documentation, analysis, and learning from each incident, organizations can convert challenges into opportunities for bolstering their security stance.

## Elements of a Proper Incident Report :

### Executive Summary : 

Let's consider the `Executive Summary` as the gateway to our report, designed to cater to a broad audience, including non-technical stakeholders. Since many stakeholders may only peruse the `Executive Summary`, it's imperative to nail this section. Here's a more granular breakdown of what should be encapsulated in the `Executive Summary` :
